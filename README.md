Very rough adaptation of Road Rage the game.



Turn Right and Left with the buttons on the top left to try and avoid the enemies.



What was implemented:

* Basic Turning
* Observer and Subject class
* &nbsp;	HUD, Client, and Enemy are supposed to observe the player for when they get hit and update health
* &nbsp;	However, was not able to get it properly working
* Simple States
* &nbsp;	Right now there's only Turning, with the Start and Stop State not functioning



Plans

* Add a Crash or Stop state when you run out of fuel
